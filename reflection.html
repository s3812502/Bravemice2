							<h2>Zane:</h2>
							<p>Once again, the communication and teamwork displayed by Bravemice was great. We used mostly the same processes because they worked well last time. Microsoft teams has been a very handy tool, which we use to communicate and collaborate on documents. We even linked it to Github so it shows the trails of commits. The only issue we faced this time was with one of our team mates. Trevor was great in Assignment 2 where he took a position of leadership. However, he went away at the end of assignment 2 and we didn’t hear from him at all until we were half way through assignment 3, at which time he told us that he refuses to put in any work for assignments 3 and 5 due to his above average input in assignment 2. This was very surprising as assignment 3 and 5 are worth 60% of our course marks. Very selfish of Trevor. I was pleased at how our group handled this though – we accepted it and split up Trevor’s parts accordingly. I think it is agreed upon that Trevor will receive 0% for his input in our SparkPlus feedback so I hope the marks are reflected accordingly. The only thing I would change next time I work in a group, is I would encourage all group members to use Microsoft teams from mobile devices, because this would make for faster communication. As we were all communicating from work stations only, there were times where responses took annoyingly long. But overall, I’m very pleased with Bravemice’s work ethic and adversity!</p>

							<h2>Brad:</h2>
							<h4>What went well </h4>
<p>Each member of the group took the initiative and applied themselves well. We had a solid platform for communication on Microsoft teams from the start, thanks to Trevor. Also, there were no major conflicts or miscommunications within the group for Assignment 2. For Assignment 3, I am quite proud of the wireframe for GamR, being that it was my first time using Adobe Xd. </p>
<h4>What could be improved </h4>
<p>Our general lack of experience in using github (or at least my own) caused us to rely on Trevor greatly. To avoid this when we begin on our project I think it would be best for most members of our group to become more familiar with correct procedure in Github and using Branches. In assignment 3 we were fairly slow to start as well as progress, I think if we started earlier and with more enthusiasm it may have helped to propel ourselves into the assignment with more momentum.</p>
<h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
<p>I found the overall attitude and initiative that each member of our group took was pleasantly surprising, and is probably due to the level of maturity of each member. In Assignment 3 I was surprised at how easy it was to use Adobe XD to construct the wireframe, even though it was my first time using the software.</p>
<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </h4>
<p>It is very difficult to find a time that everyone in the group is available to talk together, especially a group that is as long distant, and we mainly communicated via microsoft teams when ever we were able. I learned in Assignment 3 that it can be difficult to maintain the momentum of a groups progress, as well as the big picture or singular focus, especially when each member is working on different tasks.</p>

							<h2>Matthew:</h2>
							<h4>What went well</h4>
<p>I was really surprised on how quickly the groups formed and by the time I had a look 8 groups were already full. I found this group was really organised from the start as after the group decided that MS Teams was the way to go Trever really jumped in and setup the foundations on it. Microsoft Teams platform was a great platform as it was built for projects like ours allowing complex multiple tab communication for people with different schedules.</p>

<h4> What could be improved </h4>

<p>I think we all, but Trevor need a better understanding of CSS design elements and multiple branch GitHub repositories. </p>
							<h2>Travis:</h2>

					<p>Overall BraveMice’s performance was very good, As stated in A2, Communication throughout A3/5 seemed fine between all members. We used Microsoft teams for collaboration and google docs. I think using google docs was extremely helpful and made it easy to work on the same documents together.</p>
<p>With the amount of time we have for these assessments, we could have figured out parts to work on sooner. It wasn’t until the second week into the assignment we started to assign roles and portions for the group to complete. Having Trevor refuse to complete his parts due to his above average contribution in A2 made things a little difficult, But the group ended up picking up his slack and completing all the required parts.</p>
<p>I was surprised when I started using google docs that we could see other peoples work on the document in real time, this makes working together efficient.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to line up available time between members, especially when we work at different hours and live in different time zone, for this reason teams was perfect as we could leave messages and members of the team could view at first available opportunity that they have. Having been in a group with someone like Trevor, I can now understand other groups frustrations when they have an ineffective person in their team.</p>
							<h2>Chinonso:</h2>
							<h4>What went well</h4>

<p>The breakdown and delegation of parts of the assignment to individuals went well, we were well organised with this as a result everyone effectively contributed towards the assignment. We had a group conference call which I unfortunately missed, but the guys were able to delegate different parts of the assignment out effectively. </p>

<h4> What could be improved </h4>

<p> What could be improved upon was communication, especially on my part. At first it was hard because we all had different schedules, a certain amount of compromise is needed in order for all of us to communicate as a group at the same time. I will admit I wasn’t actively checking up on the group chat but later fixed that. </p>

<h4> At least one thing that was surprising </h4>

<p> I was pleasantly surprised with the level of intelligence within our group, we got a lot done in a short amount of time and remained proactive with this assignment. </p>

<h4> At least one thing that you have learned about groups </h4>

<p> One thing I have learned about working in a group is that your group can be your ultimate motivator in getting things done. There were times were for whatever reason I was unmotivated or beat to even engage in the assignment. Realising that the group was reliant on me in completing my part really pushed me to step up. </p>

							<h2>Trevor:</h2>
							<p>Trevor was absent for entire assignment.</p>

							<h3>Combined Reflection:</h3>

							<p>Overall the efforts and teamwork displayed by Brave Mice were of a high standard and each member of the group took initiative applying themselves well. Trevor taking the leadership role early utilising his knowledge of GitHub to guide us was very fundamental. We had a solid platform for communication using Microsoft teams. The platform was great as it was built for projects like ours allowing complex multiple tab communication for people with different schedules.</p>

							<p>The breakdown and delegation of parts of the assignment to individuals went well and, in the end, we were well organised with everyone contributing towards the assignment fairly equally. The overall attitude and initiative that each member of our group too was surprising as most of us had never been in a group assignment before. There was no major conflicts or miscommunications within the group and that shows the efforts by all was clear and concise.</p>
							<p>A key area in which the team could benefit from in Assignment 3 is a firmer allocation of the workload in earlier stages of the project with everyone attending the group conference. Our general lack of experience in using GitHub for the majority of us caused us to rely heavily on Trevor a lot in the early stages. It would be best for these members of our group to become more familiar with correct procedure in GitHub specifically using Branches. </p>
