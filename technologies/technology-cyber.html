								<h2>Overview:</h2>
								<p>Cybersecurity can be defined as the practices involved to protect systems, networks, programs, people, and organisations from cyber-attacks; these practices ensure that the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability ( CIA ) of information on networks.</p>
								<p>Cyber-attacks are consistently evolving and ever present in the current digital age, where everything is being placed on the internet, or via other publicly available portals and servers; so it only makes sense to incorporate strong cybersecurity measures to ensure that systems are protected appropriately.</p>
								<h2>Methodologies:</h2>
								<p>
									<ol>Cybersecurity practices can be broadly categorised into 3 main parts:
										<li><b>Confidentiality</b>;</li>
										<li><b>Integrity</b>;</li>
										<li><b>Availability</b>.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<h3>Confidentiality:</h3>
								<p>The privacy of information that is stored on systems, and the security measures in place to prevent unauthorised access. All access to sensitive information should be restricted to set personnel ( roles ), and the ability and authority to change such permissions given only to appropriate cyber-aware personnel.</p>
								<p>When it comes to the confidentiality of information, user training regarding risk factors involved in safeguarding information &mdash; i.e. strong passwords, and change management of organisational culture around information sharing &mdash; is integral to any cyber-security strategy.</p>
								<h3>Integrity:</h3>
								<p>Managing of consistency and accuracy of data on systems; meaning the appropriate people are making changes to files that they have access to, and such changes adhere to ( preferably mandatory and enforced ) standards &mdash; i.e. where invalid entries are not accepted by the system, any more than invalid user access is allowed. This includes checksums of files, backups, and redundancy. </p>
								<h3>Availability:</h3>
								<p>The correct functioning of a system, and the ability for clients to maintain continuous reliable connections ( without any downtime ). Availability includes, load balancing, system updates, and patching to prevent vulnerability exploitation; this also includes safeguards against data loss. </p>
								<h2>Risk Assessment:</h2>
								<p>Vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses allowing cyber-attacks to occur.</p>
								<h3>Risks:</h3>
								<p>Risks are the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.</p>
								<p>Loss includes information, systems, and even people.</p>
								<p>Cybersecurity professionals take risks into account when conducting threat assessments, and figure out the risk vs need factors for an organisation. Risk management should be done at least regularly ( if not continuously ), and is key to good cyber-security practices.</p>
								<h3>Threats:</h3>
								<p>Threats are newly discovered incidents with the potential to do damage, these can be natural, intentional, and unintentional threats. Threat assessments should be conducted regularly to ensure that repeat incidents do not occur, which can be achieved via penetration testing, and used for further cyber-security training.</p>
								<p>There are various ways to protect systems from cyber threats, and this can be done using the <i>Identify, Analyse, Evaluate and Treat</i> methodology.</p>
								<h3>Cyber Criminals:</h3>
								<p>A 'hacker' is someone who writes computer code, so this term is often misused in place of the correct term 'cracker', which specifically refers to a person ( usually also a hacker ) that uses technology to gain unauthorised access to information or data &mdash; i.e. they crack through security barriers such as encryption, passwords etc. So 'hacking' only really refers to 'writing code', but 'cracking' is using these and other related IT skills to crack security.</p>
								<p>Most crackers target companies with a lot of employees, and typically arenâ€™t focused on any one person. They usually just want to get as much personal data as possible from as many people as possible by finding security flaws; most of the time this information is then used for profit.</p>
								<p>All data is considered valuable, but banking information &mdash; such as bank card numbers, ID cards, and pin numbers &mdash; is amongst the most valuable, as it can be used to steal a victim's identity and resources. Other information such as email addresses and passwords are also valuable, because crackers can try to use them with other online accounts.</p>
								<h3>Targeted Phishing Attacks:</h3>
								<p>As stated in the <i>Council Post: Five Cybersecurity Trends To Watch For In 2019</i>: there are an increasing number of cybersecurity trends and challenges to watch for this year, one of particular note being phishing attacks.</p>
								<p>Phishing attacks continue to be the most pervasive IT security threats, with more people falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated and technologically evolving attacks.</p>
								<p>According to the article published by Dalvin Brown, Phishing attacks have increased by 297% between 2017 to 2018. Organisations need to urgently adopt strong security measures in order to combat advanced phishing strategies and techniques, as these types of attacks will only become more complex and difficult to spot with every passing day.</p>
								<h3>Opportunities:</h3>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a hot topic, and constantly expanding within organisations, because cyber threats are consistently on the rise.</p>
								<p>As organisations enterprise environments shift towards end-of-life, many are moving from on-premise to cloud-based solutions; this creates an environment requiring strict security to prevent users from causing damage and loss to businesses.</p>
								<h3>Impact on Job Prospects & Industry:</h3>
								<p>The security landscape for organisations continues to be threatened by an increasing number of malicious actors, and with increasing frequency and sophistication. For this reason, the need for specialised people to work in roles that prevent cyber-attacks from happening, continues to grow.</p>
								<p>Technological developments continue to increase the difficulty involved in combating ever evolving cyber-crime techniques and technologies; cybercrime is without question an industry unto itself.</p>
								<p>However this creates new roles and opportunities for cyber-security professionals into the future, as businesses become aware of the risks they face, and the global demand for professionals is already a few million behind the supply ( though it is catching up gradually ). </p>
								<h2>Solutions:</h2>
								<h3>Multifactor Authentication:</h3>
								<p>One partial solution to these issues is <i>multifactor authentication</i>, which is not new, but dramatically improves a user's security. It is highly unlikely for example that a malicious actor could simultaneously fake ( and / or steal ) all three elements involved in <i>three-factor authentication</i> ( 3FA ), which makes it a more secure login method, versus a password only system.
									<ol>3FA is typically comprised of 3 components:
										<li><b>Knowledge</b> &mdash; password, username, ID and PINs;</li>
										<li><b>Possession</b> &mdash; one-time password (OTP) tokens, key fobs, and smartphones with OTP apps;</li>
										<li><b>Inherence</b> &mdash; retina/iris, fingerprint, facial/voice recognition ( aka 'biometrics' ).</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>Typical usage is within organisations that require an above average level of security ( and of course with the resources to implement such systems, and the risk of losing far more than the cost of such implementation ).</p>
								<p>At least one element from each category is require for a system to be considered 3FA. Sometimes when higher levels of security are required, four-factor authentication may be implemented, which is often achieved using the added element of <i>geo-location</i>.</p>
								<h2>Summary:</h2>
								<h3>Personal Impact:</h3>
								<p>The entire IT industry is only really a few decades old, as the internet was pretty much exclusively a military experiment at first. It has only been in the last 2-3 decades that the technology has evolved and matured, yet we have already witnessed the staggering consequences, both in terms of the benefits crackers can bring ( eg: whistle-blowers ), and the damage they can do ( eg: identity theft, electoral rigging, financial fraud, and other white-collar crime ).</p>
								<p>As a part of keeping data save, strong security practices need to be incorporated into all of our daily lives. All users, no matter their age, should make efforts to become aware of the consequences, should they fail to adopt strong cybersecurity practices.</p>
