								<h2>Overview:</h2>
								<p>Cloud Computing is defined as the delivery of remotely hosted services via the internet
									<ol>There are three main types of cloud services:
										<li><b>SaaS</b> &mdash; Software as a Service;</li>
										<li><b>PaaS</b> &mdash; Platform as a Service;</li>
										<li><b>IaaS</b> &mdash; Infrastructure as a Service;</li>
										&mdash; which are then further filtered into public, private, and hybrid levels.
									</ol>
								</p>
								<h3>Software as a Service:</h3>
								<p>SaaS is the delivery of applications over the internet, and is the most commonly-used cloud computing service, which accounts for around 60% of all public cloud spending. SaaS products are favoured for their fast and simple set-up, as they do not require installation to individual devices to be utilised by entire teams or companies. This is ideal for global collaboration, and for those who work in different locations.</p>
								<p>
									<ul>Some examples of SaaS include:
										<li>Google: Docs, Drive, and Gmail;</li>
										<li>Microsoft: Office365, OneDrive, and SharePoint;</li>
										&mdash; plus smaller player single offerings, like DropBox.
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h3>Platform as a Service:</h3>
								<p>PaaS offers developers an online platform to not only create software, but also oversee storage, networking and virtual machines &mdash; eg: Microsoft Azure.</p>
								<h3>Infrastructure as a Service:</h3>
								<p>IaaS offers the most hands-on and customisable model. This is ideal for companies that want full control in building applications from the ground up, from the physical and virtual servers to storage and networking. Around two thirds of users had said that it is easier to innovate with online infrastructure, and had reduced deployment time of new applications and services, as well as substantially lower maintenance costs. This model does, however, require greater technical skills and as such is sure to be a contributor to driving the demand for experts in cloud computing.</p>
								<h2>Historical / Technological Comparisons:</h2>
								<p>One article<sup>(5)</sup> drew a comparison between the future potential of cloud computing and the creation of the first power stations, which centralised and aggregated the distribution of electricity into every household. Meaning that cloud computing has the potential to cause a substantial change to our everyday lives just like power stations had in the past, if not greater. They go on to say that by the end of 2015 88% of entrepreneurs had transferred their companies to the cloud.</p>
								<h2>Current State of the Industry:</h2>
								<p>Although cloud computing has been around for almost a decade, the technology is just recently becoming a real competitor with conventional server infrastructure by appealing to large businesses and corporations. According to the <i>International Data Corporation</i> ( IDC ), more than a third of all IT spending worldwide now goes to developing the infrastructure to support cloud computing. However, like most emerging technologies, cloud services give rise to some very apparent real-world dangers, limitations, and industry implications.</p>
								<h3>Advantages:</h3>
								<p>There are numerous benefits of cloud computing across the services that are offered: from no longer having to own and maintain expensive servers &mdash; thus eliminating the need to decommission and dispose of obsolete hardware or software &mdash; to no longer having to update applications or operating systems. What was once standard practise is now being made obsolete by the growth of cloud computing.</p>
								<p>The biggest advantage of the PaaS model is how much control it provides IT administrators over the platform that software and applications are being built upon.</p>
								<h3>Limitations & Issues:</h3>
								<p>SaaS products, although convenient, can be rather limiting as you have little to no control over the cloud infrastructure it runs on. If your software provider experiences an issue such as an outage, for example, then so will you. This can potentially lead to far-reaching issues that are entirely out of your control, and can, in turn, impact your business processes that require SaaS products to operate.</p>
								<p>The disadvantage of the PaaS model is that you can only control what's built on the platform, like the SaaS model, if there is an outage or issue with the hardware or operating system where the platform is built on, it will take the software out along with it.</p>
								<h3>Possible Consequences for Job Prospects:</h3>
								<p>Cloud computing is making its way into the mainstream of data storage and manipulation thanks in-part due to it's convenient, on-site infrastructure free model. However, this is not without the looming and inevitable threat of redundancy to a number of current job titles that involve, among other things, the management, maintenance, and technical support for on-site server professionals. Because of its convenient framework and pay-for-what-you-use model, cloud based servers have become not only competitive with conventional on-site server technology, but they are predicted to become the mainstream.</p>
								<p>What makes cloud computing so appealing, is it's lack of heavy up-front investment, maintenance, and upgrading of outdated hardware. It is for these reasons that cloud computing is making the standard on-site IT server infrastructure redundant; and the once traditional position as server maintenance for a company could become, for the most part, a thing of the past, being replaced by cloud computing specialists.</p>
								<h2>The Future:</h2>
								<p>Google themselves quote <i>IDC FutureScape</i> in saying that by 2024 not only will most enterprises favour cloud computing, but they will also utilise 'multi-cloud' &mdash; meaning multi-type and or level cloud computing &mdash; environments including on and off-site, and using both public and private computing. With the global spending for public cloud services expected to reach $277 billion in 2020. Cloud computing, with its potential and all it has to offer, will undoubtedly become enmeshed in the standard business model of the future.</p>
								<h3>Case Study:</h3>
								<p>In the future, cloud computing will offer a far safer and more secure way to navigate the internet. An article by <i>Gizmodo</i> highlights the inconsistency with the security of, in this particular case, the health information of American citizens. The <i>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</i> ( HIPAA ), was introduced to assure the protection of individual's health information whilst still allowing easy access by health care providers. However, despite this, only large hospitals and academic medical centres met these security standards whilst many of the smaller practices ( medical imaging centres, radiologists, etc. ) did not.</p>
								<p>The article describes an incident in April, 2019, where 145,000 rehab patients medical files were leaked online, and then in 2017 the medical records of tens of thousands of patients at the <i>Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Centre</i> in New York, were held on insecure servers run by a third-party IT service.</p>
								<p>As medical communities moved from analogue to digital, their methods for storing and sharing patient information and data were left exposed on the internet; all that anyone needed in order to find that data, was access to the internet, and to know where to look.</p>
								<p>The companies that created the software for medical imaging and medical devices, had assumed that the health care providers were the ones responsible for securing the data. When contacted, the companies shifted the blame to those who maintained the servers where the data was stored.</p>
								<p>Due to the lack of cloud computing services and infrastructure, there was no established and standardised method for storing and securing data on the internet. This shows there is a dire need for secure, well established internet-based infrastructures to offer a safe and centralised platform to store and share data across the internet.</p>
								<p>Medical information and other sensitive data should be kept in private cloud servers by reputable cloud providers. Because cloud providers will be solely focused on securing their clients data, great steps will be taken to do this, from cutting-edge cyber security software to severely restricting physical access to their data centres, requiring security keys and biometric scanning.</p>
								<p>In spite of all this &mdash; due to its highly centralised data infrastructure &mdash; cloud computing could potentially become a huge liability to security in the future, becoming the dedicated focus for hackers looking to strike the motherload ( so to speak ). Nevertheless, only time will tell as to just how effective cloud computing will be at protecting its clients data. Regardless, choosing a reputable cloud provider will be a far safer option than any alternatives that exist now, or will exist in the future.</p>
