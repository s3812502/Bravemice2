								<h2>Overview:</h2>
								<h3>What is it?</h3>
								<p>Machine learning is a branch of <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> ( AI ), which involves computers learning from data, recognising patterns, and making decisions by themselves.</p>
								<h3>Example:</h3>
								<p>Laurence Moroney from TensorFlow created a game of '<i>rock paper scissors</i>', where you can play against a computer. To teach the computer to recognise the user's hands as rock paper or scissors ( via orthodox methods ), would take huge lengths of complex code; on the other hand if we were to give a computer many images of rocks and tell it that they are rocks, then the same for paper and scissors, the computer could distinguish between these images without human help &mdash; this is machine learning ( <i>TensorFlow</i>, 2019 ).</p>
								<p>So, in broader terms, if we give a computer data and answers, it can work out the rules itself, so long as it is given an engine for working out such rules based on that data.</p>
								<h2>Current State of the Industry:</h2>
								<p>Today, breakthroughs in machine learning seem to be reaching a plateau, but this doesn't mean the research is slowing down. There's plenty more technology yet to be explored with our current level of knowledge, and we can see this with new products being announced regularly. We can expect to one day live in a world where machine learning is in almost every product we use, but today we're in the phase where the products begin to spill out of the industry ( <i>J.Vincent</i>, 2019).</p>
								<p>Artificial intelligence is having huge impacts in many fields including healthcare and the music industry. In healthcare, machine learning is improving the speed, accuracy, and cost of diagnosis. For example: researchers at Genetech and Roche, are using machine learning to predict which patients are at higher risk of going blind due to diabetes related complications. When given images of the inside of the eye, the computer can isolate objects which put the patient at risk ( <i>V.Combs</i>, 2019 ).</p>
								<p>Another example ( more applicable to everyday life ) is Oral-B's artificially intelligent toothbrush, which helps people to improve their brushing technique. It tracks which areas of the mouth are being brushed, for how long and with how much pressure and uses machine learning to offer personalised advice to help optimise toothcare. This technology could potentially save people lots of money on dental bills.</p>
								<p>AI in the music Industry is being used in almost every aspect of music creation, from producing original beats, to writing melodies. While it may be unlikely that a machine can generate a 'good song' &mdash; because music is a form of artistic expression, and computers don't possess the emotional or any other human qualities necessary to be artistic &mdash; it is nonetheless proving to be very effective in the 'mastering' process ( fine tuning a song, to balance individual elements and optimise playback ). Mastering can be very expensive, so AI mastering must sound like a treat to underground artists.</p>
								<h3>Latest Evolution:</h3>
								<p>The latest development in machine learning is a technology called <i>Deep Learning</i>. Deep learning is a type of machine learning which is modelled from neural networks of the human brain. It has produced some promising results, such as defeating the number one human player of '<i>Go</i>' ( a board-game that is said to be far more complex than chess ).</p>
								<p>Deep learning has been around for some time now, but only now that we have computers powerful enough to model a neural network, does it make sense to implement the technology. This technology, combined with the enormous amounts of data we have today, has the potential to make revolutionary advances in machine learning in the near future.</p>
								<p>Whilst regular machine learning models reach a plateau in their performance, deep learning continues to improve as more data becomes available, and larger neural networks are formed ( <i>J.Brownlee</i>, 2019 ). Perhaps this could this be our best shot at real '<i>artificial general intelligence</i>'.</p>
								<h2>Likely Industry Impact:</h2>
								<p>This technology has the potential to make changes to its own source code, and therefore get better and better at learning. The implications of such a technology are inconceivable to humans, as some experts believe it could potentially do thousands of years of human equivalent work in a single day!</p>
								<p>This could go either way, good or bad for humans, depending on the objectives and values which are coded into the artificial intelligence. If all went well, we could be dealing with an intelligence capable of solving all our environmental and humanitarian problems. Although arguably we already know those answers, we just don't have the political will to do anything about it, and AI is unlikely to change that.</p>
								<p>It could be the start of a new, perfect world, but the idea of a technology which can do everything for us raises some controversial questions
									<ul>&mdash; such as:
										<li>how to organise the distribution of wealth if AI causes widespread job redundancy;</li>
										<li>what if AI had no need for humans?</li>
										&mdash; how would we then find purpose in our world?
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h3>Immediate & Personal Impact:</h3>
								<p>As we ponder such questions, what are the known implications of the technology today?</p>
								<p>On the bright ( optimistic ) side, machine learning has shown to be saving lives when used in healthcare. Cancer detection for example is improved drastically with machine learning interpreting mammograms 30 times faster and with 99% accuracy ( <i>T.Wilson</i>, 2019 ).</p>
								<p>Machine learning is increasingly present in everyday life:
									<ul>&mdash; providing services such as:
										<li>adjusting photos you take on your phone;</li>
										<li>assisting in music creation and other artforms</li>
										<li>judging your CV when applying for jobs online.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>There is no doubt that some professions will become redundant as machine learning gets better. As we have already discovered, music mastering is being done much faster and cheaper than a professional human. It's hard to say exactly which jobs will be taken over, but surely it's time people start considering this when choosing a career path.</p>
								<p>Today however, AI demands an influx of data scientists to implement the technology &mdash; IBM for example recently employed 140 new data scientists in an attempt to solidify their place in this technology of the future ( <i>N.F.Mendoza</i>, 2019 ).</p>
								<p>Personally, as an aspiring IT professional, machine learning will significantly influence my career. I have already started learning to code in both Java and Python, which are both substantial languages for artificial intelligence, and I see myself using these skills in my future career. Even if I don't code the actual artificial intelligence, or end-up in another field of IT, whatever technology I work with could likely have some machine learning involved. So it's likely I will need to learn more about machine learning in my career aspirations.</p>
								<p>For others &mdash; family, friends, colleagues &mdash; machine learning will have some impact in life, though it's hard to say exactly how so for any individual. Generally, we will have less to worry about in terms of our health, with AI helping us to live healthy lives, by taking data on our movements throughout the day, and offering personalised healthcare advise. We can also rest assured that AI will help to ensure early detection of many diseases. With cancer being a burden that my family and many others must face, AI can take some of the anxiety away.</p>
								<h2>Summary:</h2>
								<p>We can access more and more creative resources, such as music mastering to allow us to pursue artistic pathways. I for one will make use of this resource to master the music produced by my band.</p>
								<p>We can even have hope for a future free of today's environmental and humanitarian crises if we are optimistic.</p>
								<p>We do however need to be wary of machine learning; with such a powerful technology, we could face all sorts of threats: from wealth distribution, to world annihilation. Now is the time to make sure this technology is implemented the right way, in order to pave the way towards a brighter future.</p>
