								<h2>Overview:</h2>
								<p>Autonomous Vehicles ( AV ), as the name implies, are vehicles capable of action and response without human direction. Various forms of this technology exist, such as driverless trains which have been around for quite some time, which is possible due to the limitation that a train must always travel on tracks, with completely predictable variables.</p>
								<p>Environment differentials and corresponding technical challenges, are the reason why we see driverless trains as commonplace, but not driverless cars.</p>
								<p>Driverless cars are the most desired of all automated vehicles, however they seem to be the most elusive to achieve.</p>
								<p>
									<ol>The <i>Society of Automotive Engineers</i> classifies AV into 5 levels:
										<li><b>Driver Assistance</b> &mdash; accelerate, brake, or steer, but not simultaneously;</li>
										<li><b>Partial Automation</b> &mdash; can accelerate, brake, and steer simultaneously;</li>
										<li><b>Conditional Automation</b> &mdash; limited self-drive scenarios ( driver attention required );</li>
										<li><b>High Automation</b> &mdash; limited driver-free self-drive scenarios ( no driver attention );</li>
										<li><b>Full Automation</b> &mdash; universal driver-free self-drive scenarios ( no steering wheel );</li>
									</ol>&mdash; with money being no object, you can currently purchase a level 2 – 3 AV.
								</p>
								
								<p>Australia's Sydney Metro is the first example of a train system without a driver, the technology can be found in other countries around the world for around 20 years.
								Trains are much easier to automate as their environments are far more controlled and predictable; they don't have a steering wheel as they are on tracks, with all other trains on that line having also been automated. All trains can communicate, and stations are stationary, allowing for simple programming. They are fundamentally, just a massive, modular, and largely horizontal elevator.</p>
								
								<h2>History:</h2>
								<p>In the short term, autonomous cars will likely see companies investing billions of dollars on R&amp;D, which means some jobs available even without the finished product.</p>
								<p>The public's misconception that cars like the Tesla &mdash; with their auto pilot features &mdash; can drive unassisted, has and will continue to cause further deaths. This technology is progressing slower than hoped, and needs significant enhancement for scenarios in which the car ultimately gets it wrong, and thus a driver is required to correct it.</p>
								<p>Infrastructure is also unsuitable for such cars, and will require significant public investment in areas such as: road markings, signage, and improved lighting.</p>
								<p>In the distant future, the impact of Autonomous Vehicles &mdash; cars in particular &mdash; will change everything. Getting around won't be a hassle, and may convert a dreaded daily commute into quality downtime.</p>
								<p>Car ownership could dramatically decrease, where no one really needs to own a personal vehicle anymore, though the love of driving itself is likely to continue amongst enthusiasts, and no one will watch a race without a human driver, as it lacks the personal sentiment.</p>
								<p>Having cars simply arrive and provide on demand service, could significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, and make parking lots redundant. However even if all of this comes to pass, the transition time could last decades, due to the labour involved in actually building and modifying infrastructure.</p>
								<p>Other common things like traffic lights might eventually cease to exist, as AVs can seamlessly navigate intersections and traffic.</p>
								<h2>Consequences:</h2>
								<p>If they automated trains on my commute to and from work, I could look forward to increased efficiency and reliability. Trains might transition from double-deckers carrying around 2000 people at a time, to smaller carriages carrying around half that, but at an increased frequency, thus spreading the traffic-load more evenly and efficiently across the rail infrastructure, and leaving smaller wait times at any location on a 24/7 schedule.</p>
								<p>Autonomous cars will continue to evolve increasingly sophisticated features ( with respect to the aforementioned 5-level scale ), but they will remain expensive for the near term, and slow to achieve mainstream adoption. We will have to drive alongside &mdash; but not inside &mdash; them for the foreseeable future, until they become somewhat cheaper.</p>
								<p>Accidents between AVs and regular piloted vehicles are to be expected, with interesting legal ramifications that add more cost and risk to the R&amp;D for developers.</p>
								<p>Autonomous vehicles also bring forth some questions of morality. For example, if a self driving car were to find itself in the unfortunate situation where it is forced to choose between killing a child, or swerving and killing an elderly person - which is the right choice? on one hand it is arguable that a child's life is more valuable. But in saying that, what right does anyone have to choose to sacrifice one life to save another. This is one of many ethical concerns when it comes to autonomous vehicles. So  The big question now, isn't whether we can have self driving cars, but whether we should have them. </p>
								<h3>Personal Experience:</h3>
								<p>I recently purchased a car with level 1 autonomy, allowing me to use standard cruise control; the autonomy is triggered when the vehicles approaches the car ahead, and it slows down to achieve a pre-set distance, before coming to a complete stop ( if necessary ), or it can cruise with the vehicle in front while stuck in traffic.</p>
								<p>This level of autonomy may be simple as it is only level 1, but may be vital in reducing or preventing an accident, particularly from things like driver fatigue, and overall makes my commute easier, less stressful, and more enjoyable.</p>
