							<p>For comparing all our careers, we have found and used data from Robert Half Recruitment as we wanted a source with multiple roles from the same perspective to compare them appropriately. Getting a job description from multiple sources makes it harder to compare as there are multiple stories being told all from multiple different perspectives. One story from two perspectives can be different enough in itself.</p>
							<br>
							<h3>Similarities</h3>
							<p>Matthews job has a lot in common with Chinonso and Travis as they are all a derivation of one another with only slight differences. Security Architect duties involve reviewing current cyber system security measures/ recommending enhancements vs a Security Engineer who maintains software/hardware in relation to security vs System Analyst roles description mentions maintaining/upgrading existing system. Broadly speaking they all in a around about way are doing the same thing.</p>
							<h3>Differences</h3>
							<p>Besides teamwork and other soft skills common in the majority of IT roles, Matthew, Travis and Chinonso will need to know of developers but not be developing anything in code. I cannot see any correlations between these two distinct divides of profession to Zane and Bradley as they have decided to specialise in specific fields of coding. The others will be over seeing projects as a whole and for a chosen project, they will have broad oversight of everything with a detailed overview of the security aspects in particular. Developers will not be looking at these and generally get a brief of the solution required and then they code something to fit.</p>
							<br>

							<h2>Zane:</h2>
							<p>This ‘java developer’ position involves providing coding solutions for a big insurance company in Melbourne. The candidate would play a crucial part in the company; guiding the development of applications and design solutions. This appeals to me as a job which requires strong problem-solving skills. It also appeals to me as a position that involves working with and leading other people as the candidate must have ‘excellent communication and interpersonal skills’ to lead and guide a digital team in a wide range of activities. I would cherish the opportunity to establish connections with other people in a role like this one. The position is a 6-month contract, with an attractive salary. This could potentially create a great lifestyle for me as I could take 6-month contracts, travelling between contracts, or moving between cities. I like to be on the move, as it keeps my life exciting. The position would require highly advanced java programming skills. This is something that I’m already working on as I’m currently enrolled in ‘Programming 1’ at RMIT. Although a computer science degree would typically be suited for acquiring these skills, I think the Bachelor of IT would be enough if I choose suitable electives (something I will look further into). It also requires strong technical expertise; which I am sure I will acquire during my time in this degree. I am confident that I have the communication and interpersonal skills required for this role, and this is something I’m always looking to improve on. I will have to choose my elective subjects wisely, or potentially change my degree to computer science; to attain the skills required for such a job. I will also have to attain relevant work experience for at least 5 years. So this job will likely not be attainable until my late 20s, but I believe I will be in a job like this one day.</p>

							<h2>Brad:</h2>
							<p>This job is for a position as a Backend developer of Linux based open-source databases through cloud technology providers, utilising mostly Python; but also Go, C, and Java/javascript, and HTML. This position interests me because there are a number of qualifications which I have just recently become interested in and started learning. These include Linux systems, the Python programming language, and the open-source aspect of software development; which is something I would like to contribute towards.</p>
							<p>In order to qualify for this position or pursue a career in a similar area I will need to become familiar with Linux systems. Currently, I have no experience with Linux, however, I have recently just begun to learn it as I have installed the Ubuntu distribution of Linux onto my old Macbook Pro and will use this to begin learning. I will also need to be proficient with the Python programming language, which I have also just recently begun to learn. Thankfully, I have some minor experience with c++ programming, which is similar, and is aiding in my learning of the language. I will also require a skill set in web development and database technologies, as well as network management and systems administration skills in order to further establish my qualifications as a back-end developer.</p>
							<p>Because this job involves the use of cloud technologies, choosing to specialise in either ‘Security and Cloud Computing’ or ‘Data management’ will provide me with the necessary skills to qualify for this position. The ‘Web Programming’ (RMI-CPT270) subject can work as my official start to developing my web-based programming skills, with my focus being on back-end programming. I might also consider choosing ‘Web Development Technologies’ (CPT373) and ‘Web Database Applications’ (CPT375) as electives to further my experience and qualifications in Web and database technologies. Also, because the employer has emphasized their desire to “automate everything” I think it would be beneficial to choose ‘Scripting Language Programming’ (CPT223) as an elective subject. This subject will assist me in developing the skills needed to write software systems that can be automated.</p>

							<h2>Matthew:</h2>
							<p>My interpretation of this job is that the RBA is on the cutting edge of technology with a rather large budget to make this so. Being a bank they need to be a technical fortress and this role is one of the ones that makes that happen. The main role in this job is to be responsible for the initial planing before moving to design and implementation. The applicant will have to evaluate emerging technologies and turn them into upcoming solutions. These will be projects will enhance the banks security using new technologies or could be redesigning exisiting systems or infrastructure to do it better. The other part of this job could also be to advise from an IT security aspect on projects that involve may be largely interface or something else but could lead to IT security issues.</p>
							<p>I myself love to sit on the cusp of new technology and like to often buy new gadgets beyond my budget. While I am keeping up to date with everything coming out I can also keep new enterprise technology in mind. I am also a very inquisitive and technical and I feel this will benefit me in this role as ill need to fully understand how it is designed to work technically before seeing the possible security holes.</p>

							<h2>Travis:</h2>
							<p>The role of an Information Security Analyst involves a person to carry out various IT security measures on companies or businesses current information systems and networks to discover vulnerabilities and make plans to ensure they are handled appropriately.</p>
							<p>The role includes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Monitoring of systems networks to ensure that everything has the right level of security</li>
								<li>Ensuring that appropriate software and antivirus updates/patching have occurred</li>
								<li>Make reports of findings for IT security related matters</li>
								<li>Educate clients and work colleagues of various IT security measures in place</li>
								<li>Develop ideas to improve IT security</li>
								<li>Conduct research on latest IT issues and viruses/malware</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This position appeals to me because I find IT security an extremely interesting topic, having seen the damage that companies can receive from cyber-attacks and the impact it can have makes its very satisfying knowing you are stopping these types of attacks from occurring.</p>
							<p></p>


							<h2>Chinonso:</h2>
							<p>This role as a cyber security analyst for Viiew requires the augmenting of the companies insurance clients project. Providing analysis on security intelligence, the Cyber Security Analyst will be tasked with identifying threats (insider threat and security investigation), quality vulnerabilities and the mitigation of risks to assets. As Viiew holds clients personal information in their database, the security analyst will be tasked with securing this information using a range of security support tools.</p>


							<h2>Trevor:</h2>
							<p>There's no such thing as an advertisement for my ideal job, as it doesn't exist as a regular 'job' — it does however exist as a self-employment arrangement. I really have no desire to work for anyone else, having done over 100 jobs in my life, and so if I am doing work for others, I want it to be a client-contractor relationship, where I can define the terms on which a job is accepted or rejected ( a privilege employees don't get to enjoy ).</p>
							<p>HOWEVER, were such a job to exist, it would be one in which a corporation or billionaire basically hands me a massive budget, says "I trust you, in fact I am probably unqualified to judge your ideas, so just do what you think is right with these resources" — and then he/she/they/it leave me alone until ( and unless ) I actually ask for help ( if I ever do ).</p>
