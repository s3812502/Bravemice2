							<h1 class="major">Timeframe</h1>

							<p>Total Weeks - 16</p>
							<p>Total hours - 136</p>

							<h3><b>Week 1</b> - Planning</h3>
							<p>8.5 total hours</p>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>App concept</li>
								<li>Main objective</li>
								<li>Target audience/ market</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The initial planning phase of our app creation was relatively smooth. Being IT students and gamer enthusiasts, we wanted to create an application that resonated well with all of us.</p>
							<p>We all pitched several ideas of which our product managers reviewed, anonymously deciding to run with our lead designer Zane’s concept of “Tinder for gamers” of which we later named “GamR”.</p>
							<p>Zane had already created a similar concept of this app in a previous assignment, so much of the research was compiled from that, this helped greatly speed up our planning phase.</p>
							<p>All that was left was to write down the concept and the main objective behind the app. This assisted greatly in identifying our target market and audience that would benefit most from the app.</p>

							<h3><b>Week 2</b> - Functions and features</h3>
							<p>8.5 total hours</p>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>User profile page</li>
								<li>Private messaging page</li>
								<li>Swipe feature</li>
								<li>Push notifications</li>
								<li>Facebook login page</li>
								<li>Discovery settings</li>
								<li>Geolocations</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Wanting the app to model that of Tinder (with slight differences being geared towards gamers) we compiled several of the functions and features of Tinder that made it so appealing to users.</p>
							<p>We created a user profile page (landing page), private messaging page as well as implementing the swipe feature. Other features we included in the designs were push notifications, Facebook login page to collect and prefill users data, discovery settings and geolocation.</p>
							<p>Our product managers reviewed the suggested features and determined which were feasible within the 16 weeks we had of finalising the application. We ultimately elected not to create a premium version of this app as our lead backend developers advised it would take well beyond the 16 weeks we were allocated to completing this application.</p>

							<h3><b>Week 3 to 4</b> - UI/ UX designs</h3>
							<p>17 total hours</p>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Colou association</li>
								<li>Theme</li>
								<li>Visual architecture</li>
								<li>Page items</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Our design leads and design team with the help of our product managers were able to come up with several mock up designs for the app.</p>
							<p>We laid out the exact visual architecture for our app, wanting to evoke feelings of excitement, comfort and joy within our users, we went with the theme colour red. Keeping this theme constant within all the pages of the app.</p>
							<p>We went into great detail with these designs, understanding what each page would contain and how it would fit well with our apps primary goals/objectives. We also kept the font and text style the same across all pages.</p>
							<p>This process took roughly two weeks, requiring approval from both project managers and lead backend developers.</p>

							<h3><b>Week 5 to 8</b> - Front end development</h3>
							<p>34 total hours</p>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Handover</li>
								<li>Functionality</li>
								<li>Aesthetics</li>
								<li>Programming language</li>
								<li>Platform</li>
								<li>IOS and Android</li>
								<li>Web version</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This process picks up where the UI/UX design ends. At this stage the design team will develop interactive app mock-ups, demonstrating just what the app will look like and how it will function. All the previous ideas in relation to the UI/UX will be implemented, showcasing how the app will look and feel when it is completed.</p>
							<p>The aim for our front end team is to create an app that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. It is also important that during this stage we seek feedback in regards to the aesthetics and functionality of our app, as it would be extremely costly to make changes later down the track.</p>
							<p>Using react native to design the app, we will create both an IOS and Android version. The code written on React Native is rendered to the Native language of each platform, saving us having to retype code to suit each platforms native language.</p>
							<p>The web version of the app will be written on C Sharpe, this will require a set of new codes and will be time consuming. Dividing our team of developers in two, one team for the mobile versions and the other for the web version will mitigate some of the time lost.</p>

							<h3><b>Week 9 - 14</b> - Backend development</h3>
							<p>51 total hours</p>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Handoff</li>
								<li>Programming language</li>
								<li>Database</li>
								<li>Hosting environment</li>
								<li>platform</li>
								<li>API's</li>
								<li>Server</li>
								<li>Security</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Giving a time frame of 6 weeks to complete, this will be the most time consuming stage of our app development. The backend is a very complex stage of our app development. Our devs team will take over from the designers, creating a backend framework for the app.</p>
							<p>There are several things our backend devs team will consider during this stage, like; the programming language, database and hosting environment (infrastructure).</p>
							<p>Our devs team will use c sharp as the programming language for building our API’s which will be hosted on the AWS Cloud. The API is crucial as it structures how data is exchanged, connecting our database to any software accessing it.</p>
							<p>Our servers will also be hosted on AWS Cloud as a security measure, it will house personal information of our users and for that reason needs to be properly secured.</p>

							<h3><b>Week 15 to 16</b> - Testing</h3>
							<p>17 total hours</p>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Performance</li>
								<li>Functionality</li>
								<li>Optimisation</li>
								<li>Test protocols</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This is a crucial point in our app development, it is important that we test our app for functionality, performance and optimisation. These tests will be conducted primarily by our 3rd party development team, and will include several types of tests:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Functional Testing: Ensuring the features we planned worked as planned</li>
								<li>Usability Testing: Ensuring the app is user friendly and is intuitive</li>
								<li>Performance testing: Ensure the app performs as expected and is responsive</li>
								<li>Device specific testing: Ensuring the app functions well on all devices, all shapes and sizes</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Whist no external certifications required when launching a gamer app, having a quality test ensures we are providing a quality product to our users (future users). We will only launch the app once it has passed all tests, even if we have to push back deployment dates.</p>

							<h3><b>Week 17</b> - Deployment</h3>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Launch app</li>
								<li>Review process</li>
								<li>Modification</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Once the app is completed and has passed all testing then it is ready for launch. Our app will be subject to review, both IOS and android versions. We are however able to launch the android version onto the google play store right away as android doesn’t review new apps right away. However with IOS we would be set back a few weeks, each IOS app is manually reviewed before going live.</p>
							<p>In addition these reviews may also result in us having to make slight adjustments to the app. Although not identical some of the similarities between our app and Tinder may cause us to have to change a few things.</p>

							<h3><b>Week 18</b> - Maintenance and support</h3>
							<p>Actioned steps:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Feedback</li>
								<li>Updates</li>
								<li>Marketing team</li>
								<li>On-going support team</li>
							</ul>
							<p>At this stage it is important that we gather as much user feedback as we can. This will assist us in understanding how the app is viewed amongst users, it will also help in terms of guiding us for any future app updates and ensuring app usability and functionality.</p>
							<p>Depending on the feedback from the analytics of our app we may look into hiring a marketing team, to market our app to consumers. This will better help us in conveying what our app is about to users.</p>
							<p>It is also important that at this stage we provide ongoing support to users. We will hire a support team to facilitate this.</p>
