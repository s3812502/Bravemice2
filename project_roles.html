							<h1 class="major">Project roles</h1>

							<h2>Roles</h2>

							<p>The biggest value we bring as an app development team is that we all specialise or aim to specialise in different fields of IT. Within our team we have a combination of big picture thinkers, detailed orientated persons and technical persons, this has allowed for us to be assigned in different aspects of the project that work towards our strengths. Although no clear roles have been established up until now as we operate as a collective whole, where every voice and contribution is weighted equally. It is obvious by now that our product managers/team leaders are Travis and Trevor, both have been influential in leading and organising our efforts towards the portfolio task as well as the initial stages of the app creation.</p>

							<p>Moving forward with the creation of this app we do require established roles within our team, this will improve efficiency greatly and allow for us to set an ideal timeline for the deployment of the app GamR.</p>

							<h3>Product Managers</h3>

							<p>Our product managers Travis and Trevor are tasked with guiding the success of our project, coordinating and facilitating the daily activities of the team, ensuring that we as a team hit our team goal of the successful creation of the GamR application within the specified timeframe.</p>

							<p>Our product managers are heavily involved in the timeline of the app from conception all the way through to its launch. Leading the designer and developer teams, product managers must ensure that both teams are following the specified architecture of the project that they have set out. To achieve such Travis and Trevor will be accountable for the strategy of our team, timeline/launch date and features/ideas.</p>

							<h3>Strategy</h3>

							<p>The project managers will set the product vision and strategy for the team, ensuring that both designers and developers are bought in towards the vision. The product managers will work closely with the design leads and lead backend developers, setting clear expectations of the project.</p>

							<h3>Timeline & Launchdate</h3>

							<p>The project managers will also consult with the leads of the design and development team to consult the ideal timeline for the project. Taking in all the different factors the project managers will determine a suitable launch date for the app and will relay the timeline to the leads of both design and development teams</p>

							<h3>Features & Ideas</h3>

							<p>With the endless potential of features that could be added to the app, it is the role of the product managers to consider these features and to see if we are able to include them in the app within the specified time frame of the app creation. The product managers will also consult with the leads to understand how long each feature will take to create and to deem if they are feasible or not within the specified time frame.</p>

							<h3>Design Leads</h3>

							<p>Zane and myself (Chinonso) will assume the role of Design leads, having come up with the concept behind the app GamR and also specialising in Java development, this role is best suited to Zane and will allow him to imprint he’s concept of the app onto the UI. I too have piqued an interest in the front end side of app development and will assist Zane as a design lead.</p>

							<p>We are both relatively new to programming, so outsourcing the bulk of the coding to 3rd party designers is the more efficient approach. We will lead the team of 3rd party designers, providing the design direction and vision of GamR. Zane and myself will also coordinate the design teams works with the product managers, ensuring we are working towards our teams goals and on track for the project delivery.</p>

							<h3>Lead back-end Developer</h3>

							<p>Lead backend developer roles will be assigned to Mathew and Bradley, Bradley specialises in backend python and linux development which highly qualifies him for the role, whilst Mathew’s Cyber security expertise will provide the much needed backend security requirements considering our app will be collecting and storing users personal information on cloud servers.</p>

							<p>We will outsource a large bulk of the backend programming to 3rd party programmers, this is a more efficient approach and will have Mathew and Bradley overseeing the backend development team, ensuring the right coding standards are being upheld and prioritising what task each developer works on.</p>

							<p>Lead backend developers role is crucial at all stages of the app development and work collaboratively in the design, implementation and deployment of the app. Mathew and Bradley will also be tasked with coordinating the developers efforts both frontend and backend, ensuring all design elements and features integrate well with the backend API’s. Also ensuring the design leads follow the framework for the development of the app. Like the design leads the lead backend developers also report back to the product managers.</p>
