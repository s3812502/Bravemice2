							<h3>The big picture</h3>

							<p>Our core aim is to successfully produce the application and release it onto the various mobile app markets. We hope that the success of Gamr will change the social dynamic of the gaming community. There are several smaller goals which will be vital to achieving this including development, partnerships and marketing of our application.</p>

							<h3>Development</h3>

							<p>The development process is crucial on many levels. It could be broken down into many sub-goals but ill keep it simple for the scope of this section. Gamr will require extensive planning, coding and debugging to ensure a user friendly and feature packed application that users will fall in love with. We aim to spend the greatest amount of time on development as this will ensure a great user experience.</p>

							<h3>Partnerships</h3>

							<p>Partnerships with companies such as steam and discord, or more ambitiously - Microsoft and Sony and other gaming companies would be hugely beneficial to Gamr. This could potentially form a seamless connection between our application and other gaming services. For example, two users who have matched with each other and decided to take their relationship to the gaming consoles could link their Xbox profiles in the click of a button and go straight to playing their favourite games. Or they could become friends on Steam and play all their favourite PC games. This would add onto the core function of our app – to connect likeminded gamers – as they could go the step further and play with each other in a ‘swipe’.</p>

							<h3>Marketing</h3>

							<p>Effective marketing is of course essential to distribute and popularise the application. Its one thing to get it up and running, but if nobody knows about it then what’s the point. The final step after the app is developed and our partnerships are established would be to hire a professional in marketing to help us get the app out there. Any partnerships with already successful companies could be incredibly beneficial in this area. I imagine we will need to carry out marketing campaigns in multiple languages and hopefully spread it around the globe, as gaming is loved universally.</p>
