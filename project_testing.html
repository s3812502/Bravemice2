							<p>Gamr testing will be implemented and conducted using four main phases prior to release. These phases are referred to as the pre-alpha, alpha, beta and gamma phases for this project and follow a structure for the maturing of Gamr.</p>

							<p>Given the amount of time available to build Gamr, it is extremely unrealistic to think that this could be built over 4-6 weeks. Each stage of the project will list the milestones to be achieved with a detailed description of how these intend to be achieved over the period.</p>

							<p>Below is a list of each stage of the project and the expected delivery timeframe of them.</p>

							<h3>Pre-alpha stage (2-4 Weeks)</h3>

							<p>The pre-alpha stage can be thought of as a planning stage for the maturing of Gamr, this will consist of all key elements required to have the mobile app functioning at a minimal state before improving on it in later versions of the app. The various points below represent milestones that will be achieved for the progression into the Alpha stage of this project and include various tests over the development lifecycle to ascertain the viability of this mobile app.</p>

							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Graphical design – An easy to navigate graphical representation of the user interface for Gamr needs to be prototyped and developed, this will be conducted using adobe wireframe and validated via the team for any flaws.</li>
								<li>Functions required – The ability to login and create a profile is crucial to the success of this project, along with incorporation of machine learning technology that runs algorithms to assess viability of potential matches throughout.</li>
								<li>Storage of information and data – A functional database for all of GamR’s key functions will need to be built and tested for useability and functionality.</li>
								<li>Security and Encryption – Security is vital for the success and reassurance of all user’s data, the highest level possible for securing the data of both application information and users’ information will need to be complete as a strong priority of this project.</li>
								<li>Redundancy – Not all events can be predetermined in a advance, for this reason a data loss recovery plan will be drafted and implemented prior to the Alpha stage of the project.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>With these milestones set in place, when the stage becomes complete the overall viability of the app will be determined. Upon completion of all milestones the Alpha stage begins.</p>

							<h3>Alpha stage (4-6 Months)</h3>

							<p>This is the first stage that triggers mobile app testing.</p>

							<p>These tests will be conducted with the development team and includes the following:</p>

							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Cross-platform (iOS & Android) compatibility using “Deviceanywhere”, A mobile testing platform in the cloud.</li>
								<li>Functionally/Useability of the app</li>
								<li>Integration of Machine learning algorithms</li>
								<li>Automation and Notifications</li>
								<li>Messaging function</li>

							<p>The development team will be able to gauge success once the above has been conducted and proven and have no faults.</p>
							<p>The app will be released for beta testing.</p>

							<h3>Beta stage (1-2 Months)</h3>

							<p>The Beta stage of the project is release of the mobile app outside of the development team, this will be a functioning release with input from the users as to any problems or issues that they may have with the mobile app.</p>

							<p>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will be conducted with a reward for use system, this will be based off in-app credits. As a user accumulates credits, they can then unlock premium features of the app such as more detailed information about others on the platform. When the app is released in Beta and a user signs up for the UAT, they will be rewarded with credits, throughout the use of the app users will be presented with prompt asking about there experience and anything that they would like to see added to the app if anything. For the UAT to be successful a minimum of 50 users will need to be signed up for the Beta and UAT, this will need strong marketing and advertising to be successful.</p>

							<p>After 2 months of UAT and performance testing GamR will be officially released to the wider public.</p>

							<h3>Gamma stage (1 Month)</h3>

							<p>This consists of the app being released officially with no known bugs and continued app support and updates.</p>
