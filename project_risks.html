							<h1 class="major">Risks</h1>

							<p>Given that GamR is a mobile app that is used for communication with strangers in order to share common interests in a game, there are a few glaringly obvious risks associated with the creation of such a mobile app.</p>

							<p>The risks can be classified into a few different categories in order to understand them. A detailed risk sheet stating the risks, effects and mitigation strategies will help to understand how these should be approached and handled throughout the lifecycle of the development of GamR.</p>

							<p>GamR is predominantly going to be an mobile application platform, For the app to be developed there will be a quite a few aspects where the education and training of individuals in the team are going to have to be focused on programming and coding in order to have fully accepted GamR app. This is a risk that has been considered and is being slowly worked on over the maturing of GamR. Programming language essentials can be considered Java and C++, these two languages would make process of developing GamR much easier.</p>

							<p>There is always a risk for hardware failure when using technology, these risks are always going to be prevalent within the environment but there are strategies to mitigate them. When referring to hardware failure this can come in many forms such as power failure, network failure and even nature disasters. To mitigate this risk various methods of backups should be implemented on critical functions that relate to GamR</p>

							<p>Security is always going to be important when dealing with people’s data, users want to feel comfortable using the platform and not have any personal information stolen and/or sold to the highest bidder. For this reason, high levels of encryption on user’s data should be one of the most important aspects and risk identification for GamR.</p>

							<p>Privileged access to the system files and information should be restricted to as few people as possible with one information manager, these details should remain protected and not shared by anyone.</p>

							<p>When communicating online there is always going to be risks when talking to complete strangers. Inappropriate language and media can be share from person to person and create an online environment that does not feel safe for users. For these reasons the use of report function buttons when users feel that they are being exposed to inappropriate content will provide a platform for users to feel safe talking on when moderated consistently by GamR admins.</p>

							  <tr>
							    <th>Risk</th>
							    <th>Effect</th>
							    <th>Mitigation</th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td>System failure</td>
							    <td>GamR not functional</td>
							    <td>Multiple Database backups following the strategy of 3-2-1 backup rules.</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td>Low level encryption</td>
							    <td>Malicious people can access information that they would otherwise not have access to.</td>
							    <td>As standard incorporate standard encryption practices.</td>
							  </tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Release/loss of user’s information.</td>
									<td>Severe impact on user’s trust. GamR would have minimal users and therefore not be able to function as intended.</td>
									<td>User data storage information policy stating transparent information about how GamR handles all information stored on the platform.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Privileged Access by unauthorised people.</td>
									<td>Breach of information. Could be used to hijack GamR to be used for malicious purposes</td>
									<td>Restrictive access control for administrators. Role based privileges and monitoring tools to show log of events.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Inappropriate use of app platform.</td>
									<td>Mental impact on users, decrease in users using the platform.</td>
									<td>Content monitoring and report abuse button.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Lack of Education and Training.</td>
									<td>Unable to progress stages of GamR into full maturity in appropriate timeframes.</td>
									<td>Team training on a standard set of tools used, with specific training for other roles.</td>
								</tr>

							<p>In conclusion, these are the immediate risks identified for the project. All risks can be mitigated somehow, and these mitigation strategies have been listed above.</p>
