							<h3>Git</h3>

							<p>Git hub is a cloud hosted service based around a version control system called git and is an open source program/platform created by Linus Torvalds the person who created Linux. His desire was to solve the issue of multiple programmers working on the same code at the same time without them overwriting each other's work while allowing for off-site backup.</p>

							<p>We at GamR will mostly rely on the backup initially like various other cloud software such as solutions like DropBox and Microsoft One Drive but by using GitHub for the code in place for rapid expansion of multiple coders working on our code at once.</p>

							<p>GitHub can be used by command line or via a graphical user interface from the website or a locally installed program communicating to the GitHub via code on your behalf.</p>

							<p>The programmers in the team to start working for the day will pull a copy of the repository (Folder) from the hub to their local machine, multiple workers shall all each have a local copy of the repository with files initially all identical but as they work on their designated sections of GamR code throughout the day it will all now be slightly different. When they finish for the day, they issue a command to push their copy of the folder (Git) to the repository on GitHub. The favourite part of the process for programmers is when multiple people do this and there is a conflict git will add both versions of the same line independently for review. GitHub will also store every version independently of one another allowing users to track changes and or refer to older versions if required. If programmer A works on section A and programmer B works on section B git will combine these two changes to make one file going forward but will keep the versions in history.</p>

							<h3>Adobe XD - 22.3.12.2</h3>

							<p>Vector based graphical user interface tool specific for web/mobile app design use cases. Tools in this app are either not in Adobes other apps or are significantly improved in this app. However, it does allow for importing of assets from Adobe suite of products like photoshop and illustrator. We have used this app mainly in assignment 5.</p>
