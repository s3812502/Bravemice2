							<h3>Skills Required ( ranked most to least demand / significance ):</h3>
									<h4>Soft Skills:</h4>
										<h5>General:</h5>
											<ol>
												<li>Reading</li>
												<li>Listening</li>
												<li>Imagination</li>
											</ol>
											<p>It's hard to rank these, and it's not like this is an industry demand, since industry doesn't actually demand ( or even want necessarily ) inventors &mdash; yes they will surely claim they do in their PR and marketing etc., but it's really a bit of a lie &mdash; what they really want ( and dont have the honesty to say ), is the end result, without having to pay for it.</p>
											<p>However you'll ever be brilliant at writing or invention without being broadly knowledgeable, a good listener, and someone with incredible imagination. There's plenty of other things I could add to the list, but I think that's a good start, and I have/do all these things.</p>
										<h5>Specialised:</h5>
											<ol>
												<li>Research</li>
												<li>Psychology</li>
												<li>Communication</li>
											</ol>
										<p>Coming up with ideas is one thing, but validating them is another. Any of these could also be referred to as a hard skill, except that they're such poorly understood things by most people ( including specialists ), that there's very little point in asking for a specific skill in such an area ... not that people don't, but they wouldn't if they understood just how much of a failure some of the traditional approaches are.</p>
										<p>As an inventor and author, you're not paid ( generally ) until you have at least one finished product, therefore developing your skills resources and capabilities is tough, so you don't have time or other resources to waste on pseudoscience and wild goose chases, and you need to get very good at seeing the truth, regardless of whether it's what you expected or wanted to see.</p>
									<h4>Hard Skills:</h4>
										<h5>General:</h5>
											<ol>
												<li>Design</li>
												<li>Analysis</li>
												<li>Aesthetics</li>
												<li>Sales &amp; Marketing</li>
											</ol>
											<p>There are of course also specialist versions of such skills, but in terms of a minimum requirement, you don't need to be a specialist, just half way decent at it ( self-taught is fine ).'</p>
										<h5>Specialised:</h5>
											<ol>
												<li>Logic</li>
												<li>Mathematics</li>
												<li>Engineering</li>
												<li>Sciences</li>
												<li>Philosophy</li>
											</ol>
										<p>This is really ( I think ) where the mechanics of invention and creativity is centred &mdash; ie: regardless of whether you're writing a creative novel, or inventing a machine, your invention must be logically congruent with the domain in which it is said to exist ... for some things that domain is reality, for others it is a fictional world.'</p>
