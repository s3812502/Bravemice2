							<h3>GamR</h3>

							<p>Our project idea ‘GamR’, is a smartphone application created for gamers, by gamers. GamR’s core function is to connect like minded gamers and assist them in developing fun and meaningful relationships centred around gaming. Surely every gamer can relate to the fact that the gaming experience is so much more fun when shared with a friend! With the help of our app, and its useful and innovative functions; gamers will no longer face the obstacle of having nobody to play with.</p>

							<p>Users will swipe through a series of other gamers profiles, swiping right if they like what they see and want to become friends, or left if they don’t. Users will have the ability to customise their profiles by selecting their favourite games, listing their gaming strengths and providing images of their gaming avatars. This degree of personalisation will ensure that users get an authentic grasp of other users so they can determine with confidence that they will make a good match. We will also aim to utilise machine learning to increase the chances of finding a good match. Our algorithms will get more familiar with the users preferences as they swipe through the stack of profiles. If both users agree that they would like to be friends, they will become a match and unlock the ability to communicate using our chat interface. They can then further investigate the relationship and consider moving to the next level – gaming!</p>

							<h3>Motivation</h3>

							<p>Our motivation for this project began with our mutual love for gaming. We want to enhance the gaming experience for ourselves and everyone. As gamers, we understand and experience the pain that comes with having nobody to play with. We also understand the implications which gaming can have on mental health. WHO (controversially) listed ‘gaming disorder’ as a mental illness of its own just last year (WHO – 2018). On top of this, there has long been a stigma which associates gaming with loneliness and anti-social activity. Social interaction is vital for maintaining both mental and physical health, as you can read about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/well/live/having-friends-is-good-for-you.html">here</a>. So one of our greatest motivations comes from the need to improve the mental health of the gaming community.</p>

							<p>We also see a large demand for an app of this kind. Gaming is universally loved, so there are vast amounts of people from everywhere in the world who could make use of it. One of the biggest trends in IT today is machine learning (UTS – 2019). We want to utilise this technology in our project to make our app as innovative and effective as possible. We would also aim to utilise the Internet of Things to potentially connect our app with other devices such as gaming consoles. We are driven to use these trending technologies as we believe it will make us irresistible to future employers.</p>

							<h3>Landscape</h3>

							<p>The idea is inspired by the popular dating app ‘Tinder’, using the user friendly and addictive swipe and match interface. There are several dating apps out there now such as Tinder and Bumble which have been very successful using this style. We want to borrow this concept from the dating community and utilise it in the gaming community.</p>

							<p>There are other products out there that allow gamers to communicate. Steam and Discord are two obvious examples. But these products are used to help gamers who already know each other communicate. What makes our project stand out from these ones, is that gamers will be able to look for friends to form gaming relationships with. After this purpose is served, we would encourage our users to use apps like Steam to take advantage of the best gaming communication available.</p>
