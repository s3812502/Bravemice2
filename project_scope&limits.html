							<h1 class="major">Scope and Limits</h1>

							<p>The scope of this project will need to be heavily structured to ensure a proof of concept is achievable and of a presentable standard within the given time frame. This means omitting external features like the website that would accompany the mobile app and limiting the learning algorithm to a simple comparison model. There are many features that we would like the app to include, however, given the timeframe, we will need to limit this to the bare essentials in order to present a working prototype.</p>

							<h4><b>What can be included in the project scope:</b></h4>

							<p>

							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

								<li>The project should focus on designing the mobile app first and foremost, to present a clear proof of concept.</li>

								<li>A logo or colour theme.</li>

								<li>A simple SQL database to store user data, no cloud database will be needed for a proof of concept.</li>

								<li>A matching algorithm that checks users timezones, one favourite game and skill level and matches accordingly; OR, incorporate interactivity into the wireframe so that it effectively simulates a working program.</li>

								<li>A handful of examples to swipe through with working accept and reject.</li>

							</ul>

							</p>

							<h4><b>What should be omitted from the project scope:</b></h4>

							<p>

							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

								<li>The website for the app should be left out of the final submission to allow the group to focus on polishing the mobile app.</li>

								<li>The sophisticated learning algorithm should be left for after the proof of concept has been established, as it will likely take too long to develop and implement.</li>

							</ul>

							</p>

							<h4><b>What we would like to include in the project:</b></h4>

							<p>

							<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

								<li>Include the ability to link other popular social media accounts and gaming platforms.</li>

								<li>Usersâ€™ gamer tags on various gaming platforms like steam and battle.net could be shared.</li>

								<li>Greater customisation of a person's profile, i.e the border around a users profile to represent their favourite games, and a possible reputation level that users can contribute towards through feedback etc; going along with the gaming theme..</li>

								<li>Machine learning algorithm to provide more intuitive matches, utilising greater variety of data such as: age, multiple games comparison (a dozen or so), to further increase  the match strength between two users.</li>

								<li>Perhaps even a group matching feature could be added so users can look for a group of people to play with, along with a group chat feature so they can communicate.</li>
