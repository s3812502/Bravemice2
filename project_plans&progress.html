							<h4>How did your project begin, what precisely have you done, and what are you planning to do?</h4>

<p>GamR was created by a group of people who have passion for games, this passion for games helped identify certain areas that could be improved upon within the gaming industry. In particular the way people communicate and how they communicate when playing online games. We noticed that to thoroughly enjoy playing online games, it involves teamwork and collaboration with other people. Finding these people is not always an easy task. It can be quite difficult at times and cause stress and frustration. We noticed a universal need for an application specifically for gamers to meet other gamers and this is where the concept of GamR came from.</p>

<h4>How has your project progressed, what precisely have you done, and what are you planning to do?</h4>

<p>The project has been progressing steadily, with each completed task leading us further towards a more comprehensive concept of our project, GamR. Also, the wireframe for the mobile version of GamR has served as the focal point for the design of GamR and helped to establish the logo and colour scheme, as well as offer some new ideas and potential additions to the layout and design of the project.</p>


<h4>What stage of the plan are you up to, what precisely have you done, and what are you planning to do?</h4>

<h4><b>What we have so far:</b></h4>
<p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

<li>Discussed possible directions.</li>
<li>Chosen to proceed with GamR.</li>
<li>Set a business objective/ company vision.</li>
<li>Discussed a business plan and divided these tasks among people (Taken the tasks required from the A3 PDF).</li>
<li>Early design prototypes started.</li>
<li>Marketing started.</li>
<li>Advertising for positions.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4><b>What we are yet to do:</b></h4>
<p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

<li>Set clear time frame for a launch window.</li>
<li>Setup a test environment and or a production environment.</li>
<li>interview/hire people mentioned for the advertised positions.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Are there any dead-ends you may have followed, decisions made, or changes that have been made to the project plan?</h4>

<p>There were no major dead-ends in the project worth mentioning, however there were a number of features that we came up with but it was too late to include them.

Opening the app for the first time, the user will be greeted with a welcome screen, with a short and sweet message to tell them why GamR will transform their gaming experience. They will be prompted to enter some details to create an account, starting with their name, age, email address. Once the user has confirmed their email address via the confirmation link which is sent automatically to the address provided, they can then go ahead and set up their custom profile. We will allow as much personalisation as possible to allow users to express their individuality and therefore help people to get to know each other on a more personal basis. Users will be able to choose their favourite games, their skill levels and self proclaimed strengths and weaknesses. They can upload photos their gaming consoles, or whatever else to help them portray their identity. One thing that we don’t want is for people to swipe based on the physical appearance of the other user, so we will discourage displaying self portraits on profiles. After setting up a profile, the final stage of set up is to choose preferences. This will involve a series of questions to help us to know what kind of gaming partner they are looking for. For example, what skill level do you like to play with? Do you mind playing with people who speak foreign languages? What console do you use? Etc. This will help to eliminate incompatible gaming buddies such as those who play different consoles or don’t speak the same language. We believe that this degree of personalisation will be incredibly helpful for our users to find the perfect match!
Once this is all done, users will be ready to start swiping. This is where people will be able to have some fun with our feature packed interface. The interface will be similar to Tinders, featuring a swipe and match system. Users will swipe through a series of other users profiles swiping right to indicate they want to match, or left to indicate they don’t. Alternatively, they could use the ‘yes please’ or ‘no thanks’ buttons, or the third option being the ‘golden star’ which can only be used once a day, signalling to the other person that they like them especially. Other features will include ‘perfect match’, user based star system in collaboration with the automated match assessment tool and finally the ‘ego boost’ feature.
The ego Boost feature will temporarily move the user closer to the front of all other compatible users queues, therefore increasing matches. This is a very powerful function and therefore will only be available after the user earns it via attaining good feedback ratings. This is discussed further a few paragraphs below.
GamR will implement the cutting edge machine learning technology to assist our video game loving users in finding the perfect friend. The computer will learn a users taste and preferences based on the kind of people they swipe right for. This means that the system will get better and better at arranging the queue, the more that a user swipes. This will result in the queue being arranged in the best possible way so that people whom are most likely to match are at the front. We could even go a step further and have the machine learning based on those who have gone a step further than matching and have enjoyed playing together. 
If both users swipe right or select ‘yes please’, they will unlock the ability to chat with each other and hopefully transform their match into a long lasting friendship; a fire sparked by GamR and fuelled by the universal love of gaming. The chat interface will be similar to what most users will be used to these days with Facebook's messenger app for example. This includes the ability to send stickers, gifs, photos, videos and voice recordings. A user friendly and feature packed chat interface is essential for expressing one's individuality and having fun in the process.
<h4>Internet of things:</h4>
<p>After users have engaged in discussion and feel like they would like to play games with one another, they will hopefully be able to take advantage of the internet of things. This will link the users devices with consoles of their choice; Xbox, Playstation PC, etc. This would make the transition between making friends and playing games as easy as possible.
After users have played together, the can rate each other on attributes such as sportsmanship, friendliness, skill level, punctuality and honesty. These ratings will be displayed on every user profile for matches to see. This will give people an even better idea of the type of person they may be ‘going into battle’ with. It will help people to trust each other with is essential when forming a friendship. Our rating system will also provide another motive for people to be good to each other. If somebody tells lies on their profile for example about their skill level, or perhaps flakes people; this will show up in their reputation and they may have a hard time finding matches afterwards. If a users reputation reaches a yet undecided low, they could get banned from using GamR. We have also discussed implementing a reward system where users are rewarded for good ratings. For example if a user consistently receives 5 star ratings they could be rewarded in golden stars or even ego boosts. With this in mind, users will have further more enticement to be good to one another (if the magic of friendship isn’t already enough).
If users experience higher levels of misconduct such as bullying, they will have the option to report another user. One of GamR’s main aims is to promote positive friendships and good mental health, and as such we will take bullying very seriously and will be working to address all cases as best we can. In extreme cases such as any illegal activity, we won’t hesitate to cooperate with the police. We aim to build a 24/7 support team to make sure this all goes smoothly.
The 24/7 support team will be responsible for managing the platform and its functions. These include GamR errors and malfunctioning, report/complaint handling and quality management activities. The 24/7 support team will be able to be reached directly in the app through a chat window. All chats will be logged to improve services to avoid duplication of the same issues and used for training future staff on how to support the users better with any issues that they may face and used as evidence if need be in an investigation by authorities.
The team will be responsible for prioritisation of issues ensuring that the management of all issues are tracked and dealt with in a timely manner.</p>
